The code and tests in this project support the talk I gave at GoGaRuCo 2010 titled "Eschew Obfuscation and Omit Needless Words: Writing Clear Acceptance Tests."

The example code is a nascent Magical Commodity Exchange ("MagEx") game. It sets up 5 players, gives them a default portfolio, and allows them to make trades. For more details on the capabilities of the system, see the Cucumber tests in the features directory.

In order to run this example, you will need Cucumber and Ruby.

A note on the quality of this example: I am not proud of this code. Frankly, I'm kinda mortified to be making it public. Not only is it not finished, it's not clean. Releasing it as an example feels a little like showing dirty laundry. But despite my embarrassment, I am releasing it because I think it's more important to share than to be perfect. Feel free to laugh at it. A lot. And when you're done laughing, please shoot me an email with any suggestions you have on how to make it better.

I'm releasing this code under the Creative Commons Attribution license.
